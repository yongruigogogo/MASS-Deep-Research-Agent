# MASS Deep Research Agent

This is the complete operation guide for the MASS Deep Research Agent framework, optimized for better readability and practical implementation.

## 🚀 Framework Running Steps

1. Download the cold-start dataset files from Hugging Face and place them in the `embeddingData` folder in the project root directory. Dataset link:

   https://huggingface.co/datasets/yongruigogogo/MASS_Cold-Start_Dataset

2. Open and modify the file `/Utils/Tools.py`, replacing the embedded model address with your local/privately deployed model address.

3. Edit the configuration file `/Config/config.ini` to complete the configuration of three core parameter types:

   a. API address parameters

   b. Database connection parameters

   c. Simulation environment-related parameters

   Additional requirement: Set the API key as a system environment variable with the fixed variable name API_KEY_EXTERNAL.

4. Execute the SQL script `deepresearch.sql` to automatically create the MySQL database and related table structures.

5. Manually set your target research topic in the `main.py` file, then run the file to start the full Deep Research process.

## ℹ️ Supplementary Notes (P.S.)

1. Solution for Embedding Model Loading Failure:

   If the embedding model fails to load during the cold start phase, you can complete the embedding process in another available environment and place the final processed results in the`/Data/EmbeddingData/queryAndEmbedding`folder.

   Format examples are included in this folder for reference:

   - `query1Old`: Raw query text automatically generated by the code (without embedding processing)
   - `query1`: Final query text after embedding processing (directly readable by the framework)

2. Breakpoint Resume Capability:

   Every step of the Deep Research process performs data persistence operations (stored in the MySQL database). If the program is interrupted due to unforeseen circumstances such as network anomalies or server downtime, restarting the program will automatically resume execution from the breakpoint—no need to re-run from the beginning.
