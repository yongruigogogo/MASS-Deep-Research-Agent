MASS Deep Research Agent
Steps for running the framework:
1.Download the cold-start dataset files from Huggingface and place them in the embeddingData folder. The dataset link is as follows:
https://huggingface.co/datasets/yongruigogogo/MASS_Cold-Start_Dataset
2.Change the embedding model address in /Utils/Tools.py to your own address.
3.Modify the /Config/config.ini configuration file to configure API address parameters, database parameters, and simulation environment parameters. Set the API key as an environment variable (variable name: API_KEY_EXTERNAL).
4.运行数据库文件建立数据库。
5.Set your research topic in the main.py file, then run the file to begin Deep Research.

P.S. 
1.If embedding model loading fails during cold start, you can complete the embedding process elsewhere and place the results in the /Data/EmbeddingData/queryAndEmbedding folder. The folder contains format examples: query1Old is the query text generated by the code, while query1 is the query text after embedding processing.
2.Every step in Deep Research undergoes persistence operations. Should the program be interrupted due to unforeseeable circumstances, it can resume execution from the point of interruption.
